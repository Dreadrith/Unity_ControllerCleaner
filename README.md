# Controller Cleaner
Controller Editor's "Cleanup unused sub-assets" in a standalone and faster script.

Sub-assets are assets embedded into a parent asset but are hidden by default. Certain actions may cause sub-assets to remain as residue in a controller and build up over time without being used and only serve to bloat the controller even further and sometimes even cause issues.

**This tool can scan and clean up the residue in your controllers.**
